  * Optuna 2.0.0

## Code
* <strong>force.m</strong>: MATLAB script to generate a _COMSOL_ file, used to calculate elastic energy based on given density distribution
* <strong>force_optimized.m</strong>: MATLAB script to generate a _COMSOL_ file, used to calculate optimal configuration based on MMA

* <strong>func_*.m</strong>: MATLAB function scripts
	* <strong>func_inputs_gen.m</strong>: a function to generate input data, i.e., $\rho$ in paper
	* <strong>func_outputs.m</strong>: a function to calculate output, i.e., reciprocal of energy, 1/E
	* <strong>func_test.m</strong>: a function to evaluate the optimized solution $\hat{\rho}$ from DNN
	* <strong>func_python_api.m</strong>: an API to connect Python with MATLAB
	* Others are used to plot
  
* <strong>main_*.m</strong>: MATLAB code to generate data
  	* <strong>main_solo.m</strong>: code to implement our proposed SOLO algorithm, and generate data in subfolder "data_solo"
	* <strong>main_offline.m</strong>: code to implement "Offline" algorithm, and generate data in subfolder "data_offline"


* <strong>plot_*.m</strong>: MATLAB code to plot the data
	* <strong>plot_b_c.m</strong>: plot figures b and c
	* <strong>plot_d_e_f.m</strong>: plot figures d, e, and f
	* <strong>plot_s3.m</strong>: plot Supplementary Figure 3
  
* <strong>main_cmaes.py</strong>: python code to implement Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), and generate "data_cmaes.mat"
  
* <strong>mlopt.py</strong>: (abbreviation of Machine Learning and OPTimization) python code to train a Deep Learning Network (DNN) and obtain the optimized solution based on the DNN by Generative Simulated Annealing (GSA)

## Data
If you run the code, data will be generated and stored in subfolders:
* <strong>data_offline</strong>: data generated by the code "main_offline.m" for "Offline"
* <strong>data_solo</strong>: data generated by the code "main_solo.m" for SOLO
  
You will also get a file:
* <strong>data_cmaes.mat</strong>: data generated by "main_cmaes.py" for CMA-ES

Data is not uploaded to Github. Please download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f6Xrd9e-RAUsh9vqIqUXbEw8F1_2Qg_5?usp=sharing) or email us.

## How to run
1. Connect MATLAB with _COMSOL_ server
2. Run __force.m__ by _COMSOL_ to generate __force.mph__
3. Run __main_offline.m__ and __main_SOLO.m__
4. Prepare with connet Python to MATLAB (which has connected to _COMSOL_ server). You need to install MATLAB API for Python (see [doc](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html)) and then run `matlab.engine.shareEngine` on MATLAB. Other ways are also feasible, as long as Python can be connected to MATLAB. 
5. Run <strong>main_cmaes.py</strong>
6. [optional] Run __plot_b_c.m__ and __plot_s3.m__
7. Run __force_optimized.m__ by _COMSOL_ to generate __force_optimized.mph__
8. [optional] Run __plot_d_e_f.m__
